				The target is a max TH7, which is difficult, but should be possible using lvl 1 dragons.  Lightning spells would be better than rage.
				<br />First mistake: waking the CC troops.  This isnt necessary.  And worse, because dragons move towards the CC troops when close, the CC actually helps steer the dragons into the middle.

			<div class="caption">
				Second mistake: dropping the dragons all in one place.  There is a risk that a lucky shot from a wizard hits all the dragons.
				<br />But, most importantly this steers the dragons around the outside.  Once the troops are gone, the dragons will flame the nearest buildings...
				the elix and gold collectors in front to start with.

				The 2 dragons which went to the left airdef failed.  2 more are about to try, and these fail as well...  All the dragons are wiped out as the attack one or
