		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">This attacker is a very new TH9 who hasn't upgraded army camps, so this troop composition will work for TH8.
				<br />He does however have a low-level archer queen and the fourth spell - which helps!
				<br />The target is to get 2* on this solid TH9 base.
				The base has very heavy airdef, so dragons aren't an option, and it looks like it has double bombs, so hogs aren't a good idea... so it's GoWiPe.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">CC was woken up with a couple of hogs, and lured to the bottom with an archer, and fought with wizards/archers as normal
			<br />Doing this where the main attack will launch from means that surviving wizards join the attack instead of being wasted</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">Golems dropped in.  Usually it's better to spread them out to distract more guns - but there aren't actually many
				guns to the sides in this base.
				<br />Normal spacing would be roughly one golem at the dark barracks on left, and one at lab.</div>

		</div>
		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">More wizards and wall-breakers follow.  Again the wizards need to be spread out more to kill the distraction buildings to the side.
			<br />It's usually best to deploy wizards before wall breakers, and let them clean up some builders - breaking through the wall too quickly can cause problems.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">Pekkas launched, first wall broken and a jump spell for second.  He had more wall-breakers which could have broken that wall if he didn't have the jump spell.
			<br />Pekkas will head to the nearest building - there are still buildings on the outside which are quite close...</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">One pekka has gone round the outside - to the right.  Luckily the other has gone in and is attacking the left xbow.  Rage and heal spells dropped in
			middle to boost the attack.</div>
			<img src="screens/DS_gowipe6.jpg" />
		</div>
		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">And the TH is gone... once the wizards kill one more building it's 2*.
				<br />Even though he didn't let the wizards clean up the outside enough at the beginning and one pekka wandered off, this was still a 2* attack against a defender
				quite a bit stronger than the attacker.</div>
