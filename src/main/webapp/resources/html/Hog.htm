		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">Target is an almost max TH8 base.  The target has 3 level 6 airdef well placed behind stores, so it is very unlikely TH8 level 3 dragons can get 3*.
				<br />There are no 4x2 empty spaces inside the base which could contain 2 giant bombs, so it should be safe for hogs.
				<br />There are 4 2x2 spaces which are probably 3 teslas and 1 giant bomb - so 2 more giant bombs will be outside the base somewhere.
				<br />First step is to lure out the CC - first hog has been deployed on the right to wake up the CC.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">Archers were still emerging from the CC when the first hog died - so another (by the 2 barracks) is used because there are probably more troops in there.
			<br />This hog is dropped in a different place so it isn't killed by the first archers out.</div>
			<img src="screens/hog3.jpg" />
		</div>
		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">And a third hog was used - still might not be all of the CC troops, but they are killing the hogs now.  So an archer has been dropped at the bottom to lead them away.

			<div class="caption">CC archers killed the usual way...</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">Another hog sent in to check if there are any more troops and a few archers emerge.
			<br />It's absolutely essential to kill all the CC troops because hogs just ignore them - so even a few archers or one wizard will be able to wipe out the hogs since the hogs aren't fighting back.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">More wizards (from attacking CC this time) kill those archers at the bottom again.
				<br />And yet another hog is sent in at the top (beside gold collector) to check for any more...
				<br />Extracting 25 archers from a CC deep inside the base isn't easy!</div>
			<img src="screens/hog9.jpg" />
		</div>
		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">Nothing emerged from the CC, so all the remaining hogs follow.  Just press and hold to deploy them all as fast as possible.
			<br />Next up is healing spells - but not too soon.  Best to let the hogs take a little bit of damage and heal it up again.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">First spell going off... It isn't covering all the hogs, but that's OK - it's covering where the hogs are going to next.
				The nearest gun is the archer tower, so the hogs will attack that next.  The heal spell shouldn't be dropped right on top of the hogs, but
				instead just covering them, and also the next guns they will attack, to give them the maximum possible time inside the spell.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">Hogs have left the spell.  2 or 3 have split off - beside archer tower at top.  No point healing just 3 hogs, so they are left to their fate.
			<br />Main group of hogs starting to take damage again.  They'll go to the archer torwer, then mortar, then cannon + wiz tower + tesla next...</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">And all of those guns can be covered by one spell (hogs are just below the mortar, just inside the spell).  Perfect spell placement.</div>

			<div class="caption">The spell protected the hogs while killing all those guns.  Just 4 guns left now...</div>
