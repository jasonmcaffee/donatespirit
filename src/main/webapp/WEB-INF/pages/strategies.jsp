    <h1>Strategy - By Onyx</h1>
    <h2>Good attacks</h2>
    <div>These are strategies that we know work <b>in war</b>.  If you can get 3* some other way - that's fine!  But if you don't get 2/3* most times, then please try one of these...
        <br />Against TH8 targets <b>Dragons or hogs are best</b> - almost every 3* attack on TH8 uses one of these.
        <br />Against TH9 targets <b>GoWi variations, hogs or level 6 balloonian are best</b>
        <br />Against TH10 targets <b>GoWi variations are usually required to 2* a base with inferno towers.</b>

    <div class="body">
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Troops:</span>Dragons, dragons and dragons.  Nothing else.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Clan Castle:</span>Usually another dragon.  Level 6 balloons can also be used.  Alternatively level 4+ hogs to kill an airdef if there is one at the edge of the base - but lightning spells are usually better in this case.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Spells:</span>Rage/heal spells.  Almost any combination with at least 1 rage can be used.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Target:</span><b>Generally TH8 and below unless you have level 4 dragons</b>.  Any TH7 can be killed by level 1 dragons if used correctly - but generally lightning spells are better for TH7.
            <br />TH8: level 3/4 airdef requires lvl 2 dragons.  level 5 airdef is very hard to 3* with level 2 dragons - don't attack with level 2 unless we have run out of targets - leave to the level 3 dragons.  Level 6 airdef is possible but very hard with 11 level 3 dragons.
            <br /><b>TH9: is much harder than it looks</b> due to extra seeking air mines, and larger base.
            It is almost impossible to 3* a TH9 using a TH8 attack unless the airdef is a complete joke (level 2 or less).
            TH9 with 12 dragons and 4 spells may be able to 3* level 3 airdef depending on xbows, archer queen and layout.  Otherwise requires 12+ level 4 dragons.
            An archer queen has about the firepower of a level 4-5 airdef.
            <br />TH10: Dragons can't generally 3* against TH10 unless airdef is a joke.  Even awful airdef requires 12 level 3 dragons minimum (ie TH9 attacker).  13 level 4 dragons might be an option to rage-rush the TH if weak airdef but very strong ground defences to get 2*.
            <br />Strong air defences near the centre of the base make the target harder.  If stores are positioned correctly - in front of the airdef - it is harder.
            The position of the airdef and other buildings is very important!  Airdef at the edge of the base make the target much easier - but usually lightning spells are better if airdef is badly placed.
            If the airdef is correctly placed then results for either spell choice are similar.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Strategy:</span>Deploy all the dragons in a line along the side of the base nearest the strongest airdefs.
            You are aiming to be as near 2 airdefs as possible to kill these quickly.  Use spells only once the airdef starts shooting at your dragons.
            Rage is good when there are high hitpoint buildings (TH and stores) in front of an airdef - these take forever to burn.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Advanced strategy:</span> Dragons may seem demented, but it is possible to steer where they go at first by changing the pattern in which they are deployed.
            If deployed in one place many of the dragons will go around the outside.  If deployed in a line they will, roughly, continue in a line.  It is possible to make them converge
            more on the centre of the base - with the TH and airdef - by varying the deployment: for example by starting the dragons at the end of the line first and giving them a few seconds head start.
            Alternatively keep 2 dragons back and drop these in the middle behind the main line once the first dragons get near the airdef.  The extra drags will go to the centre and help.
            But the buildings in the base also effect the movement - high hitpoint buildings take longer to burn, and more dragons tend to end up near them.
        </div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Notes:</span>
            You <b>don't</b> need to kill the CC defenders first with this strategy - the dragons are really, really good at that.  In fact if the CC is in the middle of the base, it will
            help pull the dragons towards the middle.  Dragons move towards troops and heroes once they are reasonably close.
            <br />If your army camps have an odd number of spaces, like 175 then: (1) upgrade the last army camp to get another dragon!  (2) meanwhile use archers in the extra spaces to try and clean up some buildings outside the base so that the dragons don't wander off

        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Clan Castle:</span>Usually another dragon.  Alternatively level 4+ hogs to kill an airdef if there is one at the edge of the base so that the hogs go straight to it.  Level 6 balloons can also be used.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Spells:</span>3 lightning spells to kill one air defence before starting.  Must be 3 lightning - 1 or 2 is useless.  For TH9+ attacker, generally rage for extra spells</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Target:</span><b>TH8 and below</b>.  Any TH7 can be killed by level 1 dragons if used correctly.
            <br />TH8: level 3/4 airdef requires lvl 2 dragons.  level 5 airdef is very hard to 3* with level 2 dragons - don't attack with level 2 unless we have run out of targets - leave to the level 3 dragons.  Level 6 airdef is possible but very hard with 11 level 3 dragons.
            But if some airdefs are placed at the edge of the base so one can be hogged, a second killed with lightning, and the dragons deployed on top of the third, then the
            airdef level might be irrelevant.
            <br />TH9/10: dragons is rarely the best attack against these, and even if airdef weak rage/heal spells option is usually better.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Strategy:</span>Use 3 lightning spells to kill one airdef first.  If one is nearest the centre kill that one, otherwise the highest level.
            <br />You must be sure that your lightning will kill the airdef - wounding it is totally useless.  Level 3 airdef requires level 2+ lightning.  Level 5 airdef requires level 3 lightning.
            Level 6 airdef can be killed by level 3 in theory, but it is hard -  use level 4+ lightning.
            <br />You must place the lightning <b>exactly</b> in the centre of the base of the airdef - zoom in as far as you can before placing it.
            <br />Once that is done deploy your dragons in a line on the side of the base near the remaining airdefs (see rage/heal option for more)
            <br />If you are using hogs to kill 1 airdef, you need to be careful of the CC troops.  If the hogs are targetting an airdef a long way from the CC, there is no problem.  If the airdef is near the CC,
            you must wait until the dragons have killed the CC troops before releasing the hogs.

    <div class="body">
        <div class="item"><span class="leader" style="color: Red;">Warning:</span>Since the July update big bombs get a bonus against hogs.  A single bomb can kill lvl 1 hogs.
            2 bombs touching each other will instantly kill max-level hogs.  A hog attack won't work if there are double giant bombs inside the base - look for 4x2 sized spaces.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Troops:</span>Enough archers (or wiz) to kill the CC defenders.  Then fill up with level 2+ hogs and some wizards to help clean up.  (No more than 2 wizards for 3 hogs in total)
            This attack is very hard with level 1 hogs - they are too fragile.
            <br />At TH8 you should have about 28-30 hogs.  At TH9+ about 30-35.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Clan Castle:</span>Either more hogs or wizards.  Usually better to have hogs in cc.  CC wiz are very bad at fighting enemy cc because they are not spread out.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Spells:</span>Healing.  Rage spells are a waste - hogs are already fast with good damage, and leave the rage area quickly;  but they are fragile and need healing.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Target:</span>Any compact base where there is not space for double giant bombs inside the base.
            <br />200+20 spaces, 3 spells and level 4 hogs can 3* a totally max TH8 or weak TH9.  Level 3 hogs can 3* a well upgraded TH8, but probably not a totally maxed one.
        </div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Strategy:</span>
            Kill the CC defenders first.  If there is one wizard left in the CC, then the attack fails.  Hogs are usually good at waking up the CC troops.
            <br />Then release all the hogs in one go, in one place (some people do 2 groups, quite close together).  Once they start attacking drop healing spells just covering them, but also covering the direction the hogs are about to go next.
            Hogs only attack defences, so try and look ahead to see where they will go.  If they split into 2 equal groups, you can heal both.  If a small number split off, ignore them and heal the larger group.
            If you can keep the hogs under a healing spell most of the time you will win - the skill is in placing the healing so that it covers the hogs for as long as possible.
            Deploy any spare wizards to help clean once the hogs have killed the defences on one side of the base.
        </div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Notes:</span>
            Hog attack is more powerful than dragons on a compact target but harder!  At high TH8 and low TH9 this is the best war attack option against compact bases.
            It's hard to defend against this, but also it can be hard to get the healing spells right.  If the healing spells don't cover the hogs they will quickly get killed.

        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Strategy:</span>
            Kill the CC defenders first!  If there is one wizard left in the CC then the attack will fail.  NEVER deploy giants until the CC troops are dead.  Usually use a giant (or two) to wake up the CC troops.
            <br />The wall-breakers are important!  You need to clear enough walls so that the giants are near or past the TH and the wizards are shooting at the TH before you run out of wall-breakers.  Giants are useless at getting through walls, and once they start hitting walls with their fists the attack won't go much further.  Mortars will kill wall-breakers in one hit - release wall-breakers just AFTER mortar shots land.
            <br />If you can deploy beside the wall, then drop one barb there first to set off traps, then some giants and the first two wall breakers.
            <br />If you need to deploy away from the wall, then drop one giant, wait a second or two, then more giants and the first two wall breakers.  The delay means only one giant is hit by any traps or bombs.
            <br />Then spread out half the wizards behind the giants then two more wall breakers.
            <br />If you use a rage spell drop it inside the base, just touching the hole in the wall.
            <br />Then all remaining giants, barb king and 2 more wall breakers.
            <br />Then remaining wizards.  Doing the wizards in 2 stages helps stop them all following the distraction buildings around the outside of the base.  The second batch at least should follow the giants.
            <br />Then 2 more wall-breakers, and send off remaining wall breakers in pairs to keep the attack moving, and it is probably time for the first healing spell now.

            Any TH8 up to about level 4 airdef. <u>It's easier where air defences are at the edge of the base</u></div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Strategy:</span>
            Balloons don't shoot at CC defenders - so it's essential to kill them first.  If your archers are struggling, use some minions to help.
            <br />Traditional version: spread all the balloons in a line along one side of the base, with the minions in a line behind the balloons.  This version can struggle with level 5 balloons unless the target is fairly weak;  it works better at TH9.
            <br />Alternate where some airdef is near edge of base (often better at TH8): spread 8 or 9 balloons to target each defence, and the rest of the balloons in the gaps.
            Release minions to clean up once most defences are dead.  Balloons alone can run out of time cleaning up after killing the defences
            <br />Try to spread the balloons out a bit - when they are bunched up, the splash damage from a red bomb, or wizard towers can cause problems.
            <br />Either way once an air defence starts firing use a rage spell to speed up the balloons.
            <div class="item"><span class="leader">Notes:</span>You need high level balloons for this - there is a huge difference in stats as balloons upgrade.
                Level 4 might work against TH6 or level 1/2 air defences, but this attack is only really useful with level 5 balloons.
                The position of the air defences makes a big difference for this attack - less so for dragons.  Because balloons target defences, if the air defence is at the edge
                you can attack it very quickly.  But if it is in the middle the balloons might not survive long enough to get there.  Dragons are better for bases with reasonable air defence
                in the middle.

            Max TH10 probably needs TH10 army camps and 5 spells, or very high level heroes.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Strategy:</span>
            Usually lure and kill the CC defenders if possible.  If not it is possible to rush them.  In this case instead of the lure troops use another pekka, or, better, more witches and wizards.
            <br />To attack (after killing CC), deploy 2 golems on one side of the base spread out - maybe one a quarter of the way along, and the other three quarters.  The objective is to have all the guns on that side of the base shoot at the golems.
            <br />Then deploy a line of about 10 wizards behind, extending beyond the golems.  It can be better to NOT deploy wizards in the middle.  The intention is to kill some guns, and importantly kill any distraction
            buildings, like collectors or army camps, to the sides.  Leaving buildings in the middle standing for the moment can help keep pekkas in the right place.
            <br />Then deploy wall breakers either in the middle, or at each golem.
            <br />Then send in witches and pekkas - typically in the middle.  If there are no camps/collectors left to the sides they will go to the middle of the base.  If using witches only, spread them out.
            <br />Follow with more wizards and heroes.  An option if aiming for 3* is to use king + CC wizards as a second team around the side or back of the base to help get the third star.
            <div class="item"><span class="leader">Notes:</span>Lots of variations on this work OK.  However they share a common theme: use 2 (or 3) golems to distract guns; wiz to start attacking and clear distractions to the sides;
                wall-break or jump to make path to centre of base; and then send in the rest of the attack and drop a rage spell.  All the early work is needed to steer the pekkas/witches/heroes into the centre.
                If these are just dropped outside a base they walk around the outside and get killed by the guns.</div>

        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Target:</span>Any TH5. Most TH6.  Any TH7 with all the air defences right at the edge.  This is a low-level attack and will not 3* higher level bases.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Strategy:</span>
            If the base has all the air defences at one end, you can either start at the other end, or start beside the air defence, and then deploy the healers after the air defence is dead.
            Like giant/wizard above, deploy wall-breakers 2 at a time <b>after</b> the first giants to kill as many walls as possible.	Use the few wizards to clean up once many defences are gone - otherwise they distract the healers.
        </div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Notes:</span>This attack is lethal at TH5 or TH6, but higher levels get a lot more air defences, and these wipe out the healers.  In multi-player you can pick targets where the air defences are upgrading, but in war the air def is always active.
            <br />In war, since the CC is full, you need some archers first to kill the defenders.  These archers, the healers and wall-breakers can add up to more than 80 spaces - which doesn't leave a lot of space for real troops.
            So this is difficult to use in war attacks, and only really works on a few targets at lower levels.</div>

    <div class="body">
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Troops, CC, Spells:</span>Like Giant+Wizard, but using 2 healers and less giants, but still plenty of wizards.</div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Strategy:</span>This has the same problem as Giant+Healer - air defences can kill the healers.  But even if you manage to
            dodge the air defences, the healers tend to dither between healing the giants and wizards and heal neither enough to keep them alive.
            <br />In theory this is very powerful if you can get it to work, but it's very hard to make this effective.</div>

        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Notes:</span>Barbs and archers are cheap troops good for looting in multi-player.  If they are strong enough to get 3* in war
            then you are attacking a target which is far too easy.  <b>Use proper troops for war attacks</b> - giants/golems, hogs, balloons, dragons, pekkas.  Attacking with barbs and archers does not count as a real war attack.
            <br />A <b>few</b> barbs/archers are needed to kill the CC first.  A couple of barbs make a good bomb disposal squad to set off traps before placing giants.  And 5-10 archers can be used to clean up buildings out of the range of guns.
            These are all good - but these are not the main attack.  You shouldn't use barbs and archers as part of the main army.</div>

        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Notes:</span>In a ground attack the air defences, which are by far the most powerful guns, can't fire.  In an air attack
            cannons and mortars can't fire.  If you use both air and ground, like some giants and some dragons together, it allows ALL the enemy guns to fire at you and you take much more damage.  Best to
            stick to either ground or air.  If you want to use both - use them in different attacks!</div>

        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Notes:</span>
            Guns are stronger than troops - if one or two troops wander off they will lose a fight with a defensive gun.
            A good attack keeps the main attack mostly together so that it overwhelms the defence.
            Most of the different troops move at different speeds and aim at different targets.
            So if you deploy lots of different troops they usually wander off and fight in small groups
            and lose.  Using mostly one type of troop keeps the attack focused.
        </div>
        <div class="item"><span class="leader">Exception:</span>Giants/golems + wizards or balloons + minions <b>do</b> work as a team.
            Since the heavy units target defences they go to the front and protect the fragile units.  GoWi attacks use this to do the difficult bit, and then pekkas or witches help clean up.
            But most other combinations end up losing lots of little fights in different places.</div>
