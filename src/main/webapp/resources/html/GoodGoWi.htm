		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">This is the target and troops.  This attack is basically a GoWiPe attack, but using witches to fight enemy CC, and a couple more with the pekkas.
			Attacker is TH10, but the same attack can be done by TH9 by just leaving out the second 2 witches.
				<br />The CC fight could also have been done the normal way, using archers and wizards.
				<br />In the first screenshot the enemy CC has just been woken up with a couple of barbs (he also had a hog in case)</div>

			<div class="caption">Enemy CC is dead - main attack begins.
			<br />First golem is at the top, just under the explosion.  The survivors from the CC fight are following it.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">Second golem follows at the bottom, with wizards behind it - who will clear away the barracks and collectors.  The golems are spread out
			to the sides of the main attack to distract as many guns as possible.
				<br />Main attack will be between these.  The wizards to both sides are clearing the distractions which might lead pekkas around the outside.
				<br />Deploying no wizards in the middle leaves the dark drill and other buildings standing - which the pekkas will aim at.</div>

			<div class="caption">A couple of wall-breakers for the first wall, and a jump spell for the next 2...
			<br />Now all the collectors and barracks have been killed outside the base, the pekkas don't have much choice but to head into the middle.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">And apart from a few wizards killed by the cannon at the bottom, everyone has followed the route into the middle.
			<br />Rage spells (and freeze spells!) boost the attack at the critical moment.</div>

		<div class="screen">
			<div class="caption">The result - TH is about to die and it will be 2*.  There were too many guns surrounding that central area for the troops to have any chance of fighting
				their way out for 3*, but the TH kill was never in doubt.
				<br />Although this was TH10, exactly the same without the last 2 witches would have got 2* for TH9.</div>
